Geodio is a neural network framework designed to simplify and optimize deep learning workflows. Built with a focus on design, Geodio offers powerful tools for developing and generating neural networks with custom operations.

## Features

- **Custom Neural Network Architectures**: Define and optimize neural networks with flexible configurations.
- **Advanced Tensor Operations**: Support for matrix multiplication, broadcasting, and other fundamental tensor operations.
- **Computation Graph & Execution Engine**: Efficient computation and execution with a time-aware system.
- **Transpilation & Modularization**: Easily link and manage modules in a computational graph.
- **Gene Expressed Operations**: Expressed programs as genetic seqences that can be evolved.
